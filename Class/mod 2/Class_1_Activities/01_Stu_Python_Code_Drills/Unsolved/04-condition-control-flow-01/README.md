# Variable and Conditional Review

In this activity, you will review variable declaration and conditionals.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/condition-control-flow-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Declare a variable `budget` and assign it a value of 5000.

2. Declare a variable `rent_cost` and assign it a value of 1500.

3. Declare a variable `utilities_cost` and assign it a value of 150.

4. Declare a variable `food_cost` and assign it a value of 250.

5. Declare a variable `transportation_cost` and assign it a value of 350.

6. Declare a variable `computer_cost` and assign it a value of 2000.

7. Declare a variable `total_cost` that takes the sum of all costs above (excluding budget).

8. Write an if statement that checks whether the sum of all the costs is within the budget.

    * If so, print "You're total cost is " concatentated with the `total_cost` variable.

    * Else, print "You're over budget by " concatenated with the difference between `budget` and `total_cost`.

9. Write an if statement that checks whether the `rent_cost` is larger than the sum of the `utilities_cost`, `food_cost`, and `transportation_cost`.

    * If so, print a string that says "The rent is too darn high!".

    * Else, print a string that says "Ahhh just right!"

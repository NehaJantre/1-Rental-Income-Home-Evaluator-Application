# Return to Functions

In this activity, you'll get more practice with functions. By including a return value, functions can build upon each other. Those return values can be used elsewhere in the code. Otherwise, we can't refer to values created within functions outside of them.

## Instructions

Perform the following:

1. Define a function `warble` that takes in a string as an argument, adds " arglebargle" to the end of it, and returns the result.

2. Print the result of calling your `warble` function with the argument "hello".

3. Define a function `wibble` that takes in a string as an argument, prints the argument, prepends "wibbly" to the argument, and returns the result.

4. Print the result of calling the `wibble` function with the argument "bibbly".

5. Define a function `print_sum` that takes in two numbers as arguments and prints the sum of those two numbers.

6. Define a function `return_sum` that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those two numbers.

7. Define a function `triple_sum` that takes in three arguments and returns the sum of those three numbers.

8. Define a function `dance_party` that:

    * Takes in a string as an argument.

    * Prints "dance!"

    * Updates the string from calling the `wibble` function with that argument.

    * Updates the string from calling the `warble` function with that argument.

    * Returns the updated string.

9. Print the result of calling your `dance_party` function with your name as the argument.

    ```
    # Should result in:
    # dance!
    # MyName
    # wibbly MyName arglebargle
    ```

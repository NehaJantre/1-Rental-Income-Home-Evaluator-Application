# Fun with functions

In this activity, you will get more practice with functions. Functions are a great way to wrap chunks of code so you can use them later. Functions take in an argument and work on that argument. If you `return` a value, you can use that value when you call the function. Remember, after you define a function, you have to call the function in order to actually execute its contents.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/functions-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Define a function `having_fun` that prints "Functions are FUN!"

2. Define a function `thirty_seven` that prints the sum of 18 and 19.

3. Call the two functions you've defined so far.

4. Define a function `hello` that takes in a string parameter and prints the parameter variable.

5. Call your `hello` function.

6. Define a function `average` that calculates the average between two parameters and returns the average.

7. Call the `average` function and assign a variable `calculated_average`. Then print `calculated_average`.

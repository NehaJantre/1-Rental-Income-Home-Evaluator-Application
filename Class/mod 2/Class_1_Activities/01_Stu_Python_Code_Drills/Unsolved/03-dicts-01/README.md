# Dictionaries and Bracket Notation

In this activity, you are given two dictionaries. They are actually the same dictionary, except that one contains content, and the other doesn't. Your job is to convert the dictionary _without_ content into an exact replica of the dictionary that is commented out.

You may not create a new dictionary; instead, use bracket notation to populate the empty `san_francisco` dictionary. You will know you have completed the challenge when your print statement matches the dictionary that is commented out.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/dicts-01.py) and perform the following:

1. Recreate the content of the commented-out `san_francisco` dictionary by using bracket notation to manually add each of the key-value pairs (including nested objects).

2. Print the manually modified `san_francisco` dictionary. Confirm that the contents match the commented-out version.


## Hint

Using bracket notation with dictionaries to add key-value pairs looks like the following:

```san_francisco["state"] = "California"```

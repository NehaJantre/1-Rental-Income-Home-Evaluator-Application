# More Practice with Variables

In this activity, you will get more practice declaring, printing, and concatenating variables.

## Instructions

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/variables-01.py) and perform the following:

**Create string variables.**

1. Create a variable named `subject` with no value (i.e. set the value to None).

2. Assign a value of "Programmers" to the variable `subject`.

3. Create a variable, `first_name`, and assign it a value of an empty string.

4. Assign a value of "Ada" to the variable `first_name`.

5. Create a variable, `last_name`, and assign it a value of a string, "Lovelace".


**Create integer variables.**

1. Create a variable, `birth_year`, and assign it with an integer of 1815.

2. Create a variable, `death_year`, and assign it with an integer of 1852.

3. Create a variable, `age_at_passing`, and assign it a value of `death_year` minus `birth_year`.


**Print the variables.**

1. Print: "First Name: " and `first_name`.

2. Print: "Last Name: " and `last_name`.


**Concatenate and print variables.**

1. Create and print a variable, `statement_one`, by assigning it a value of a concatenated string: "Programmers: Ada Lovelace was born in 1815, and she lived to be 37 years old."

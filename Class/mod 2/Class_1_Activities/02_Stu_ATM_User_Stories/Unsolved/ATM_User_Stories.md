# Building an ATM Application

Before writing any code for a new software application, a developer must first understand what that application will be expected to do. With this in mind, let's develop the user stories associated with a basic ATM application.

## Background

A **user story** is a concise description of a software requirement from the perspective of the person who desires that feature. User stories adhere to the following three-part template:

> As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

  * **As a [type of user]:** This part refers to the person or role who requires the new feature.

  * **I want to [some goal]:** In this part of the template, you need to express what the user is trying to achieve. This statement should be free of technology implementation details.

  * **So that [some reason]:** This part of the template will help you prioritize features by reframing the benefit the user wants to gain in terms of the bigger picture of the problem solved. If you can't write this part of the user story, you might consider omitting this feature.


## Instructions

Think of the ATM application in terms of its user stories.

> “Think of an ATM machine. Applying user stories as the framework for the business needs and software requirements, what basic functions do all ATM machines perform?”

Create the following ATM user stories:

* As a user of an ATM, I:

* As a user of an ATM, I:

* As a user of an ATM, I:

* As a user of an ATM, I:

* As a user of an ATM, I:

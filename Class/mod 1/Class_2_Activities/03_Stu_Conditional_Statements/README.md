# Conditional Statements

In this activity, you’ll get more practice declaring and manipulating variables, as well as using `if-else` statements.

## Instructions

Open the starter file and complete the following steps.

### Create Character 1

1. Create a variable called `c1_name` and set it equal a string "Mr. Farley".

2. Create a variable called `c1_age` and set it equal an integer, 65.

3. Create a variable called `c1_profession` and set it equal to "Web Developer".

4. Create a variable called `c1_location` and set it equal to "San Francisco, CA".

### Create Character 2

1. Create a variable called `c2_name` and set it equal a string of "Mr. Snuggles".

2. Create a variable called `c2_age` and set it equal to an integer, 30.

3. Create a variable called `c2_profession` and set it equal "Accountant".

4. Create a variable called `c2_location` and set it equal to "Oakland, CA".

### Use Conditionals

1. Write an `if-else` statement to check if `c1_name` is equal to "Mr. Farley", with the following criteria:

    * If so, print a string of "Hello Mr. Farley", using the `c1_name` variable.

    * If not, print a string of "Hello stranger".

2. Write an `if-else` statement to check if `c2_age` is greater than `c1_age`, with the following criteria:

    * If so, print a string of "Mr. Farley is older than Mr. Snuggles".

    * Else if `c1_age` is greater than `c2_age`, print a string of "Mr. Snuggles is older than Mr. Farley".

    * Else, `c1_age` must be equal to `c2_age`, therefore, print a string of "Mr. Farley is the same age as Mr. Snuggles".

3. Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_profession` is equal to "Web Developer" AND if `c2_profession` is equal to "Accountant", with the following criteria:

    * If so, print a string of "Look a Web Developer and an Accountant".

    * Else, print a string of "They are professionals."

4. Write an if-else statement to check if `c1_location` is equal to "Oakland, CA".

    * If so, print a string of "Mr. Farley comes from the home of the Raiders!".

    * Else if `c2_location` is equal to a string of "San Francisco, CA", print a string of "Mr. Farley comes from the home of the 49ers!"

    * Else, both conditions must not apply, therefore, print a string of "Mr. Farley doesn't hail from a sports town."

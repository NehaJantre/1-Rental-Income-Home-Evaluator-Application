# The Conditional Conundrum

In this activity, you’ll create a Python script that implements conditional statements using comparison and logical operators.

## Instructions

Review each of the five conditional statement scenarios included in the starter file. Try to determine the results before running the code.

1. Open the [starter file](Unsolved/conditionals.py). Review the examples and determine the output for each conditional statement. Do NOT run the code yet; try to guess what might happen. 

2. Once you've guessed, run the file and confirm if your guess was correct.

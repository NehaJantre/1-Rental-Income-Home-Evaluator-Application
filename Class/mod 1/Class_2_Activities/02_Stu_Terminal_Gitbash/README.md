# Getting Familiar with Terminal or Git Bash

In this activity, you'll practice running commands in the terminal. macOS users access the terminal via the Terminal application. Windows users access it via Git Bash. 

## Instructions

1. Navigate to your `FinTech_Workspace` folder.

2. Use the `ls` command to view the contents of that folder.

3. Use the `pwd` command to find the current path you're in.

4. In `FinTech_Workspace`, create a new directory named `Activity-1`. Then list the contents of the current directory again to check that it worked.

5. Navigate into the directory you just created, `Activity-1`.

6. Create a new file named `hello.md`. List the contents of the current directory again.

7. Rename the `hello.md` file to `coding.md`.

8. Inside the `Activity-1` directory, create a new directory named `terminal`.

9. Move the `coding.md` file into the `terminal` folder you just made.

10. Delete the `terminal` folder.

11. Delete the `Activity-1` folder.

## Hint

Use the Terminal Cheat Sheet if you need guidance on which terminal commands should be used for each step.

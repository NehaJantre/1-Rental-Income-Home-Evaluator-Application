# Working with Dictionaries

In this activity, you'll practice working with dictionaries, a fundamental data structure in Python.

## Instructions

Using the [starter code](Unsolved/dictionaries.py), manipulate the following dictionary according to the instructions. 

    ```python
    student_loan_information_aj = {
        'student_name': 'Amy Johnson',
        'university': 'Yale',
        'academic_year': '2015_2016',
        'loan_amount': 45000,
        'duration_years' : 10,
        'payments_started' : False
    }
    ```

1. The student's name is spelled incorrectly. Update the value of the `student_name` key to `Amy Johnston`. Print the dictionary so that you know your code works.

    **Hint:** Remember to use bracket notation.

2. Every loan should have an interest rate associated with its information. Add a key called `interest_rate` and assign it a value of 3.5% (or 0.035). Print the dictionary so that you know your code works.

3. The key for `loan_amount` is spelled incorrectly. Delete the existing key-value pair, and then add a new key-value pair with the correct spelling. You can use the same amount of `45000`. Print the dictionary so that you know your code works.

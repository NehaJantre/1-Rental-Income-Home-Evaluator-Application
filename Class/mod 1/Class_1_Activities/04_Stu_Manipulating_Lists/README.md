# Manipulating Lists

Accessing list elements and manipulating lists will be critical to your success in this module, as well the Challenge assignment. In this activity, you'll get additional practice doing both.

## Instructions

Using the starter file and the `stock_tickers` list, update, add, and remove elements according to the instructions. After each action, print the list to confirm that your syntax is correct.

See the following `stock_tickers` list:

`stock_tickers = ['AMZN', 'CSCO', 'FB', 'GOOG','INTC', 'MSFT', 'SQ', 'TWTR', 'WRK']`

1. Update the ticker `'WRK'` to `'WORK'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

2. Add the ticker `'ZM'` to the end of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

3. Add the ticker `'AAPL'` to the beginning of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

4. Add the ticker `'DELL'` so that it appears between `'CSCO'` and `'FB'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

5. Remove the ticker `'INTC'` from the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

6. Remove the ticker `'SQ'` from the list using the `pop()` method. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.

7. Slice a section of the list that includes the tickers `'CSCO'`, `'DELL'`, `'FB'`, and `'GOOG'`. Set this equal to a variable called `stock_tickers_slice`. Print the new variable to confirm your code.

## Hint 

Use this [guide to Python list methods](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list) if you have any questions about list operations.
